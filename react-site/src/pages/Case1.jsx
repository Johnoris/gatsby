                    including the damage tenants were doing to the property, 
                    and that all they did was supervise activities like cleaning the compound 
                    and making sure water and electricity were available.
                <br />
                    We learned from our conversation that he was spending more than 
                    N4,000,000 on repairs out of the N10,500,000 in rental income. 
                    He had 28 apartments, just three of which were occupied, 
                    and he was having trouble finding tenants for the 25 other apartments. 
                    He was unsure of the magic we would use in this circumstance because, in his opinion, 
                    "Are you not all the same?"

                    Our solution also had to be landlord friendly. For example, solutions that make landlords give up
                    revenue for 7
                    years are clearly abhorrent and take advantage of landlords' desperation. <br/></p>

                    deserted building to filled in 30 days with guaranteed rent!</h2> <br/>

                    We invested about N25,000,000 to turn around this apartment building, branded it ‚Äúthe studio
                    community‚Äù and sold
                    it as a community for ambitious professionals. We definitely installed amenities and services to
                    ensure for
                    example,
                    a minimum of 18 hrs of power daily. <br/>

                    Mr. J starts earning from year 2 and of course, rent value got raised by over 45%. In fact only 10%
                    of
                    the apartment was filled when we took over so that‚Äôs even a staggering difference if we consider the
                    difference
                    between day 1, when we took over renovations and day 60 when apartments were filled. <br/>

                    Our partner company, Liveable, got us the best tenants. These tenants work in investment banking,
                    consulting,
                    technology,
                    corporate entertainment and medical services.It‚Äôs a great combination for both the tenants and
                    landlords.

                    There are many similar buildings spread across Nigeria that could do with a transformation even with
                    less
                    investment. The real question is, who‚Äôs partnering to make this happen?

                    Thanks to our partners, Mr. J got great tenants, accesses guaranteed rent (even if there‚Äôs a
                    default) and are
                    certain that their apartment/property value will appreciate rather than depreciate. We saved the day
                    for Mr J
                    and prevented him from potentially selling the property at below market value or entering a
                    partnership that
                    would be financially draining for him.

                    When we presented progress reports to Mr J, his response is exactly what we want landlords to fill -
                    excitement
                    and peace. His words : <b>‚ÄúI knew something was wrong, I just couldn‚Äôt tell what it was‚Äù </b>
